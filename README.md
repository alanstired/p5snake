# Snake P5 Re-creation

For my January IDP, I made a recreation of the classic game Snake while using the functions of P5.JS. The code is split up into many small sections, such as canvas creation, updating the snake, randomizing the fruit generation, detecting collision, and keeping a score counter. I was considering adding sound effects (so it could have the same effect as accidentally playing other versions of snake during class), but ultimately scratched that idea (that wasn't something anyone asked for anyawy). This version has a monochrome theme to emulate the old days of playing this game on a monochrome display (without the green-yellow background).

Instructions: 
- Use either Arrow Keys or WASD to move
- Aim to collect the fruit (circle) without running into yourself or the wall
- If you would like to restart, reload the page

I found this project to be on the simpler and shorter side, but I still learned from making this and found it interesting and fun.
